# Components

This directory contains reusable React components.

## Guidelines

- Create components as TypeScript files (`.tsx`)
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Export components as named exports or default exports as needed

## Example Structure

```
components/
├── ui/              # Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
├── layout/          # Layout-related components (header, footer, etc.)
└── features/        # Feature-specific components
```
