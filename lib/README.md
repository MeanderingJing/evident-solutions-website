# Lib

This directory contains utility functions, helpers, and shared logic.

## Guidelines

- Create utility functions as TypeScript files (`.ts`)
- Keep functions pure and testable when possible
- Organize related utilities into modules
- Export functions as named exports

## Example Structure

```
lib/
├── utils.ts         # General utility functions
├── api.ts           # API helper functions
├── constants.ts     # Application constants
└── types.ts         # Shared TypeScript types
```
